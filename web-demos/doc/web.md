```
A web page is a simple document displayable by a browser. 
Such documents are written in the HTML language (which we look into in more detail in other articles).

A web page can embed a variety of different types of resources such as: 
- style information — controlling a page's look-and-feel
- scripts — which add interactivity to the page
- media — images, sounds, and videos

Note: Browsers can also display other documents such as PDF files or images, 
but the term web page specifically refers to HTML documents. Otherwise, we only use the term document.

- web site: 网站
```
A website is a collection of linked web pages (plus their associated resources) 
that share a unique domain name. 
```
- web server: web服务器
```
A web server is a computer hosting one or more websites. 
"Hosting" means that all the web pages and their supporting files are available on that computer. 
The web server will send any web page from the website it is hosting to any user's browser, per user request.
